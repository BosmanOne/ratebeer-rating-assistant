# ratebeer-rating-assistant
Assistant that help rating beers.

Objective:

Create aplication that would help rating beers in Ratebeer.com.

Details:

This application was meant to help ratebeer.com community in rating beers as currently implemented rating assistant in the page is not so functional. Design was based on physical images that some ratebeer users use to describe properties of drinks. Project was not fully completed because of problems with ratebeer API. Also the 'circle' design is having problems with web browsers other than Chrome and needed some fixes.
